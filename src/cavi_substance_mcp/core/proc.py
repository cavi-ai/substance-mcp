"""Bounded subprocess execution for the Adobe command-line tools.

Host side only (asyncio and process control). The Designer and Sampler runners use it,
so the limits, the deadline and the kill rules are written once:

* stdout and stderr are each bounded; what was dropped is reported, not hidden;
* one deadline covers the whole run, however the process behaves;
* on a timeout or a cancellation the process gets SIGTERM, a short grace period and
  then SIGKILL, signalling its whole process group on POSIX; on Windows the whole tree
  is ended with ``taskkill /T /F``;
* the run ends when the process exits, not when its pipes reach end-of-file, so a
  daemonised grandchild that inherited stdout cannot hold the caller for as long as it
  lives.
